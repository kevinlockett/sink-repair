# Maude & Merle Sink Repair Service

This project introduced the basics of asynchronous programming and working with Web APIs.

It included discussion of the differences between Permanent State and Transient State, and introduced the use of HTTP Fetch request methods.  I focused primarily on GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, but I also used PATCH in this project to update a simple boolean on each object.
